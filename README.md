# EConflux

A library for binning and geolocation of multi-method geophysical data.

EConflux is designed to support users conducting joint geophysical investigations by providing functions to assist with georeferencing, co-locating, processing, and interpreting complementary geophysical datasets.

The current version of EConflux is designed to be incorporated into workflows using ResIPy (https://gitlab.com/hkex/resipy) and EMagPy (https://gitlab.com/hkex/emagpy) but should provide a suitable foundation for users looking to incorporate the functions into other inversion codes.

## Installing EConflux

Currently, it is recommended to install EConflux by cloning the repository and adding the path to the "code" folder to your system paths.

```
git clone https://github.com/c-terra/EConflux <directory_name>  # Replace <directory_name> with path that you wish to clone EConflux to
```
See the Jupyter Notebooks in the "examples" folder to see how the EConflux classes are called.

NOTE: The Jupyter Notebooks in the "examples" folder might require additional packages not included in requirements.txt
